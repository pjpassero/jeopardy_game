<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
  I built this game simply for fun back in high school. It actually was meant as a tool for a trivia night for my Boy Scout troop, but it never made it to its intended use. That's ok though because I built the app out and added some sweet features that I came up with during the development process. More important, it was a lot of fun to build!
